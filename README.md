# It's a Getting Started repository to React Native.

# What I've created...
- Navigation examples such as DrawerNavigator, a CustomHeaderNavigation inside of StackNavigation and a example of TabNavigator.
- Login flow for operations like register, authentication and JWT validation.
- I've used Axios with interceptors as a client requester and AsyncStorage to store the token.
- Designed layouts based on youtube tutorials - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7gT462aBU0

# Back-End - Folder: IdentityCoreJWT
- C# .Net Core API to register users, authentication and authorization actions based on JWT, claims and roles.
